 <h3 align="center">Project: Online Code Editor</h3>

Description:
Create an online code editor that allows users to write, compile, and run code directly in the browser. The code editor will support syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages and provide features like code auto-completion, code execution, saving, and sharing of code snippets.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

**Step 1: Set Up the Basic Structure**
- [ ] Create a new project folder and name it "OnlineCodeEditor".
- [ ] Inside the "OnlineCodeEditor" folder, create the following files: "index.html", "styles.css", and "script.js".
- [ ] Create a subfolder named "extra" inside the "OnlineCodeEditor" folder to store additional files and libraries.

**Step 2: Design the User Interface**
- [ ] Open "index.html" and set up the basic HTML structure.
- [ ] Create a layout for the code editor with a textarea for code input and a separate div to display the output or console results.
- [ ] Add buttons for code execution, saving, and sharing snippets.

**Step 3: Implement Syntax Highlighting**
- [ ] Download the CodeMirror library and place its CSS and JS files in the "extra" folder.
- [ ] Link the CodeMirror CSS file to "index.html" for syntax highlighting in the code editor.
- [ ] In "script.js", initialize the CodeMirror editor with the appropriate configuration for the selected programming language.

**Step 4: Code Auto-completion**
- [ ] Explore CodeMirror's built-in features or available plugins for code auto-completion.
- [ ] Implement code auto-completion functionality in "script.js" for the supported programming languages.

**Step 5: Code Execution**
- [ ] Create a new file named "languages.js" inside the "OnlineCodeEditor" folder.
- [ ] Define an object in "languages.js" that contains configurations for each supported programming language, including syntax highlighting rules and code execution methods.
- [ ] In "script.js", implement the logic to execute the code based on the selected language and display the output in the output area.

**Step 6: Save and Share Code Snippets**
- [ ] In "script.js", add functionality to allow users to save their code snippets to local storage or a database.
- [ ] Implement a feature to generate a shareable link for a specific code snippet, enabling users to easily share their code with others.

**Step 7: Styling and Responsiveness**
- [ ] Open "styles.css" and add CSS rules to style the online code editor interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- [ ] Ensure that the code editor is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

**Step 8: Testing and Debugging**
- [ ] Thoroughly test the online code editor with different programming languages and edge cases to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility.

**Step 9: Documentation**
- [ ] Write clear and concise documentation in a separate "README.md" file on how to use the online code editor.
- [ ] Include instructions on supported languages, features, and how to save/share code snippets.

Completing the core functionalities within the 2-day timeline is the primary focus. Additional features and language support can be added after the core functionality is implemented. Remember to maintain code organization and readability throughout the project. Good luck with your project!Project: Online Code Editor
